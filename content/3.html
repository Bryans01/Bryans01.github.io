It was a dark and stormy night. The rain was pouring down, and the thunder was crashing through the sky. The wind was howling so fiercely that it felt like the world was shaking. No one was out in this terrible storm, except for one lone figure.

This figure was a young girl, no more than twelve years old. She was standing in the middle of the street, her arms outstretched and her head tilted up to the sky. She was letting the rain wash over her, and for a moment it seemed like she was actually enjoying it.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning lit up the sky, and the girl was illuminated in a brilliant flash of light. She stood there for a moment, seemingly unafraid, as if she was embracing the storm.

The wind was getting stronger and stronger, and the rain was coming down in sheets now. But still, the girl remained standing there, seemingly mesmerized by the power of the storm.

And then, in an instant, the storm was over. The rain stopped, and the wind died down. The girl slowly lowered her arms, and looked around. The street was now silent and still, as if the storm had never happened.

The girl looked up at the sky, a look of wonder on her face. And then, she smiled. She had survived the storm, and she had embraced it. She knew that she was now even stronger than before. 

The girl walked away, the memory of the storm still fresh in her mind. She was no longer afraid of the storm, and she knew that she had the strength to face anything that came her way.
