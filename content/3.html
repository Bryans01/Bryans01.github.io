Once upon a time, there lived a very curious cat named Mango. Mango was always looking for new ways to explore and learn new things. One day, while exploring the riverbank near his home, Mango came across a group of fishermen who were fishing with rods and lines. Mango was fascinated by the sight and wanted to try it for himself.

So, he asked the fishermen if he could try. At first, they were hesitant, but after seeing how determined Mango was, they decided to teach him how to fish. After a few hours of instruction, Mango was an expert at fishing and was able to catch fish with ease.

Word soon spread of Mango’s newfound skills and people from all around the area came to watch him fish. They were amazed at how quickly and skillfully Mango had learned to fish.

Mango became a local celebrity and the fishermen who had taught him were proud to have been part of Mango’s journey. Now, whenever Mango goes fishing, the people of the town come to watch and cheer him on.

Mango’s story is proof that with a lot of hard work, determination and a little bit of help, anything is possible.
