Once upon a time, there were dragons that roamed the lands. They could be seen soaring in the skies, breathing fire and causing chaos. The dragons were feared and admired in equal measure, and their presence kept the people of the land in awe.

One day, a great wizard appeared and told the people that the dragons were leaving. He said that the dragons had been called to a far-off land to serve a powerful king. This news spread quickly, and soon all the dragons were gone.

For many years, no one knew what had happened to the dragons or where they had gone. Some people speculated that they had gone to the ends of the earth, or even beyond. Others believed that the dragons had gone to a secret realm, hidden away from the rest of the world.

Whatever had happened, one thing was certain: the dragons were gone, and they were not coming back.

Years later, a small group of explorers discovered the secret realm where the dragons had been living. It was a beautiful and mysterious place, full of breathtaking sights and wondrous creatures. The dragons were living peacefully and happily in this new land, and the explorers were astonished to see them.

The explorers returned to their home, and the news of the dragons and their new home spread far and wide. People were amazed and excited to hear that the dragons had found a new home, and they hoped that one day they would return to their old land and reclaim their rightful place in the skies.

But the dragons never returned, and they remain in their secret realm to this day.
