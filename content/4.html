            Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who loved to stare at the moon. She would sit on her balcony every night, gazing up at the glowing orb in the sky, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

One night, as she was admiring the moon, she noticed a shooting star streak across the sky. She closed her eyes and made a wish, hoping that it would come true.

The next day, Lily woke up to find that her wish had indeed come true. She had won a trip to a beautiful island resort, where she would spend a week lounging on the beach and enjoying the sunshine.

As she arrived at the resort, she was greeted with warm smiles and friendly faces. The staff welcomed her with open arms and showed her to her luxurious room, complete with a balcony overlooking the ocean.

That night, Lily sat on her balcony once again, staring up at the moon. But this time, she was filled with a sense of happiness and contentment. She had never felt so at peace with the world around her.

As the days passed, Lily made new friends and tried new experiences. She went snorkeling, parasailing, and even tried her hand at surfing. She laughed and smiled more than she ever had before, feeling truly alive.

On her last night at the resort, Lily once again sat on her balcony, staring up at the moon. But this time, she didn't make a wish. She simply smiled, knowing that she had everything she needed right there in that moment.

As she returned home, Lily carried that sense of happiness with her. She continued to stare at the moon every night, but now it was a reminder of the joy and adventure she had experienced on her trip. And she knew that she would always cherish those memories, and the happiness they had brought her.
