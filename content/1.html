Once upon a time, there was a small goblin who lived in the depths of a dark forest. He was a mischievous creature who loved to explore the world around him.

One day, the goblin found himself wandering near a stream when he noticed a strange, glowing red gem on the ground. His curiosity got the better of him and he carefully picked up the gem and held it in his hands. As he examined it more closely, he realized that the gem was not just a regular gem, but a magical one.

He quickly tucked it away in his pocket and went on his way, eager to find out the secrets that the red gem could hold.

The goblin spent the next few days trying to discover the power of the red gem. He found out that it could grant him strength, speed, and even the ability to fly. He was amazed at the power that the gem gave him and decided to use it to his advantage.

The goblin used the gem to help him explore the forest, find food, and even make friends. He was so happy with his newfound power that he decided to keep the gem and never let it out of his sight.

The goblin was so content with the gem that he began to tell everyone about it. Word of the magical red gem spread far and wide, eventually reaching the ears of a powerful wizard.

The wizard was intrigued by the stories he heard and decided to track down the goblin and the red gem. When he finally found them, the wizard offered the goblin a deal. He would make the goblin his apprentice and in exchange, the goblin would give him the red gem.

The goblin was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to the wizard's deal. The goblin became the wizard's apprentice and used the skills he learned to help others.

As for the red gem, it was never seen again. But the goblin never forgot the magical power that the red gem had given him and was forever thankful for the adventure it had brought him on.
