Once upon a time, there lived an ostrich in the middle of the desert. It was the only ostrich in the entire desert, and it was quite lonely.

One day, the ostrich was walking through the desert, looking for something to do. Suddenly, it heard a loud noise and saw a group of people riding on camels. The ostrich was excited to see other living creatures, so it followed the group of people.

The people were on their way to a large city, and when they arrived, the ostrich was amazed at the sight. There were so many people and buildings, and it was a far cry from the lonely desert it had been used to.

The ostrich followed the people around the city, watching them do their daily activities. It was fascinated by the sights and sounds of the city, and it soon found itself a part of the group.

The people were very friendly to the ostrich, and it became a regular part of their group. The ostrich even joined in on their activities, such as going to the market and visiting the local sights.

The ostrich had never been so happy. It had gone from being lonely in the desert to being part of a large, bustling city. It was no longer an outcast, but a beloved member of the group.

The ostrich continued to live in the city, and it was always welcomed with open arms. It had gone from being a lonely ostrich in the desert to being a beloved member of the community.
