Once upon a time, there lived an old wise dragon deep in the heart of a mystical forest. He had lived for hundreds of years and was considered by many to be the most powerful creature in the kingdom.

One day, while out hunting, the dragon came upon a small, glowing egg. He was intrigued by it, and decided to take it back to his cave. Upon further inspection, he realized that the egg was none other than a dragon egg! This was a rare and unique find.

The old dragon carefully carried the egg back to his cave and placed it in a nest made of straw and blankets. He then decided to keep a close watch on the egg and make sure nothing happened to it.

The days went by, and the egg began to crack. Finally, one day, a small dragon emerged from the egg. The old dragon was overjoyed and couldn't believe his luck. He named the baby dragon "Eggbert" and doted over him, teaching him all the ways of a dragon.

Eggbert grew quickly and soon was able to fly and breathe fire. He and the old dragon became fast friends and enjoyed flying around the forest together and exploring.

The years passed, and Eggbert grew into a powerful dragon himself. He was a fierce protector of the forest and the old dragon was proud of him.

The old dragon eventually passed away, and Eggbert carried on his legacy. He watched over the forest and kept it safe from any danger that may come. He was a respected and beloved dragon, and his story was told for generations to come.

The dragon egg had been the start of it all. It was a reminder that even the smallest things can have a great impact.
