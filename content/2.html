            I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to create images. However, I can describe an inspirational cover image related to the topic "I used to run."

The cover image shows a person standing at the starting line of a race, looking determined and focused. The background is a blurred image of a city skyline, indicating that the race is taking place in an urban area. The person is wearing running gear and has a number pinned to their shirt, indicating that they are a participant in the race. The title of the book, "I used to run," is written in bold letters at the top of the image, while a subtitle, "Finding motivation to start again," is written in smaller letters below it. The overall tone of the image is one of determination and resilience, indicating that the person in the image is ready to take on any challenge that comes their way.
